Simple text-based  calculator in Python
# Simple Python Calculator — First Mini Project

I've been learning Python for about a week, and this is my first mini project. It's a **text-based calculator** that runs in the terminal and supports basic arithmetic operations.

This project helped me practice:
- `while` loops
- `try/except` blocks for input validation
- User interaction with `input()`
- Working with chained operations
- Error handling (like division by zero)

---

## Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Exponentiation (`^`)
- Input validation for numbers and operators
- Division by zero protection
- Continuous calculation until user exits with `result` or `=`

---

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user for the first number.
2. Then it enters a loop where:
   - The user selects a math operation.
   - The user inputs another number.
   - The calculator updates the result.
3. This continues until the user types `result` or `=`.

## Future Improvements (Ideas)

- Add support for modulus `%` and square root `√`
- Use functions to organize the code
- Track operation history
- Allow undoing the last operation
- Add GUI using Tkinter or web interface
